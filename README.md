# SecureBin

A simple application for sharing text securely with client side encryption.

> As the application packages crypoto code (frontend typescript modules) into the binary, the Anti-virus software may prevent you from downloading or using it. If so, you can pull the source code and build it on you own. 

## Usage

Download the binary from [Releases](https://github.com/zhangyuan/securebin/releases).

Start the server:

```bash
securebin server -l :8080
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> in the browser.
